# Security Integration

## Existing Security Measures

**Authentication:** SonarQube built-in authentication (no separate auth for plugin)
**Authorization:** SonarQube permissions control access to reports
**Data Protection:** AI API keys encrypted via SonarQube Settings API
**Security Tools:** SonarQube self-analysis for code quality

## Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:**
- PDF configuration (logo path) validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Logo file size limited to 500 KB to prevent DoS via large file uploads
- PDF content does not include sensitive system information (absolute paths, API keys)
- iText library kept up-to-date for security patches

**Integration Points:**
- Use SonarQube Settings API for secure configuration storage (same as AI keys)
- Logo files stored in restricted SonarQube data directory (not publicly accessible)
- PDF generation rate-limited via SonarQube's existing request throttling

**Compliance Requirements:**
- iText AGPL license compliance documented in README
- PDF/A standard compliance for long-term archival (regulatory requirement)

## Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** SonarQube self-analysis on plugin code
**New Security Test Requirements:**
- Path traversal attack test (malicious logo path)
- Large file upload test (> 500 KB logo)
- PDF content security test (no sensitive data leakage)
**Penetration Testing:** Not required for this enhancement (isolated internal feature)
