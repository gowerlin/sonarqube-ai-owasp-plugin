# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

**Ready for Story Implementation:**

Dear Story Manager,

The brownfield PDF report enhancement architecture is complete and validated. Key points for story creation:

**Architecture Reference:** `docs/architecture-pdf-enhancement.md`
**PRD Reference:** `docs/prd-pdf-enhancement.md`

**Key Integration Requirements Validated:**
- PDF generator implements existing `ReportGenerator` interface (no modifications)
- Reuses all existing data models (`AnalysisReport`, `SecurityFinding`, `ReportSummary`)
- Isolated in new `report/pdf/` package (zero impact on Markdown generator)
- Configuration via SonarQube Settings API (consistent with existing patterns)

**Existing System Constraints:**
- Java 11+ compatibility required
- Plugin JAR must stay under 60 MB
- PDF generation must complete in < 15 seconds for 100 issues
- iText 7 AGPL license must be documented

**First Story to Implement:**
**Story 1.1: iText 7 Integration and Basic PDF Infrastructure** (See PRD Section "Story 1.1")

This story establishes the foundation (Maven dependencies, `PdfReportGenerator` skeleton, basic configuration) with clear integration checkpoints to verify existing Markdown generator remains functional.

**Emphasis on System Integrity:**
- Each story includes "Integration Verification" section to test existing functionality
- PDF feature is fully additive - no deletions or modifications to existing code
- Use feature flags if needed to disable PDF during development

Proceed with confidence - the architecture is solid and validated against the real project structure.

## Developer Handoff

**Ready for Implementation:**

Dear Developer Team,

Welcome to the PDF Report Enhancement implementation! This enhancement adds enterprise-grade PDF reporting to our existing Markdown report system.

**Architecture Document:** `docs/architecture-pdf-enhancement.md`
**Coding Standards:** Follow existing Google Java Style Guide, use `Pdf` prefix for all classes

**Integration Requirements:**
1. **Implement `ReportGenerator` Interface:** Your `PdfReportGenerator` must implement the existing interface without any modifications to the interface itself.
2. **Reuse Data Models:** Use `AnalysisReport`, `SecurityFinding`, `ReportSummary` as-is - no changes allowed.
3. **Isolated Package:** All code goes in new `com.github.sonarqube.report.pdf` package.
4. **Configuration Storage:** Use SonarQube Settings API (see `MarkdownReportGenerator` for examples).

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **PDF Library:** iText 7.2.5+ (AGPL license - document clearly)
- **Chart Library:** JFreeChart or XChart (your choice, both work well)
- **Caching:** Caffeine Cache for chart images (already in project)
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, target ≥80% coverage

**Existing System Compatibility:**
- **Verification Step 1:** After each story, run `MarkdownReportGeneratorTest` - it must pass 100%
- **Verification Step 2:** Manually test Markdown report generation - must work identically
- **Verification Step 3:** Check plugin JAR size - must stay under 60 MB

**Implementation Sequence:**
Follow the 8 stories in PRD exactly as written - they're sequenced to minimize risk:
1. Story 1.1: Basic infrastructure (Maven deps, skeleton classes)
2. Story 1.2: Document structure (cover, TOC, headers/footers)
3. Story 1.3: Executive summary tables
4. Story 1.4: Visual charts
5. Story 1.5: Detailed findings with code snippets
6. Story 1.6: SonarQube UI integration
7. Story 1.7: Error handling and performance
8. Story 1.8: Testing and documentation

**Critical Success Factors:**
✅ Existing Markdown reports still work perfectly
✅ PDF reports contain same data as Markdown reports
✅ PDF generation < 15 seconds for 100 issues
✅ Test coverage ≥ 80%
