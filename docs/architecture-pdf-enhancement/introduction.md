# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the SonarQube AI OWASP Security Plugin with **enterprise-grade PDF report generation capability**. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of the PDF reporting feature while ensuring seamless integration with the existing report-generator module.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing project architecture (`docs/architecture.md`) by defining how the PDF report generator will integrate with current systems. The enhancement follows the existing Strategy Pattern for report generators and reuses all existing data models, ensuring zero disruption to current Markdown report functionality.

## Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State

- **Primary Purpose:** AI-driven OWASP security analysis plugin for SonarQube with intelligent fix suggestions
- **Current Tech Stack:** Java 11+, Maven 3.8+, SonarQube Plugin API 9.9+, Jackson 2.x, OkHttp 4.x, Caffeine Cache 3.x
- **Architecture Style:** Maven Monorepo (7 modules), Strategy Pattern for report generators, Builder Pattern for data models
- **Deployment Method:** SonarQube plugin JAR, deployed to `$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins/`

### Available Documentation

- Comprehensive PRD v1.0 (`docs/prd.md`) covering entire plugin functionality
- Detailed architecture document (`docs/architecture.md`) with 7-module structure
- Project brief (`docs/brief.md`) with market analysis and user personas
- PDF Enhancement PRD (`docs/prd-pdf-enhancement.md`) completed 2025-10-20

### Identified Constraints

- Must use Java 11+ for SonarQube 9.9+ compatibility
- Cannot modify existing `AnalysisReport`, `SecurityFinding`, `ReportSummary` data models
- Must implement `ReportGenerator` interface (`generate()` and `getFormat()` methods)
- Cannot impact existing Markdown report generator functionality
- Plugin JAR size must not exceed 60 MB (currently ~50 MB)
- PDF generation time must be < 15 seconds for 100 security issues
- iText 7 AGPL license requires clear documentation for enterprise customers
